# Hello, I'm Noe Trevino!

I am currently pursuing a Graduate Degree in Computer Science at the University of North Texas. 

Right now, I am really trying to sharpen my skills in the web development area, as well as algorithms as I am trying to get ready to get a job. 

I learned a lot of Angular and Java at my most recent internship, and I plan to continue using Java/Spring/Hibernate for as many backend pursuits as I can, but will begin leaning more on React as that is more employable with the current job market.

At the moment, I am learning React and Django, and still honing my skills in Java.

## Technologies I know:
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Angular
- **Backend**: Java, Django
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
- **Other**: Neovim/Vim, Linux, MacOS, DBeaver, 

## What I'm Doing Now
- Building a sight reading application designed for public school music programs
- Consistenly practicing data structures and algorithms
- Learning big data science techniques
- Deigning malware for a cybersecurity class
