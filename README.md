# Hello, I'm Noe Trevino!

I am currently pursuing a Graduate Degree in Computer Science at the University of North Texas. 

Right now, I am really trying to sharpen my skills in the web development area, as well as algorithms since I am trying to get ready to get a job. 

I learned a lot of Angular and Java at my most recent internship. I plan to continue using Java/Spring/Hibernate for as many backend pursuits as I can, but will begin leaning more on React for my frontend frameworks, that is more employable with the current job market.

At the moment, I am learning React and Django, and still honing my skills in Java.

## Technologies I know:
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Angular
- **Backend**: Java, Django
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
- **Other**: Neovim/Vim, Linux, MacOS, DBeaver, Python

## What I'm Doing Now
- Building a [sight reading application](https://github.com/TheNoeTrevino/sight-reading-app) designed for public school music programs
- Consistenly practicing [data structures and algorithms](https://github.com/TheNoeTrevino/ds-and-algos)
- Learning [big data science](https://github.com/TheNoeTrevino/school-assignments) techniques
- Designing [malware](https://github.com/TheNoeTrevino/no-hope) for a cybersecurity class
